**Why?**

Multi is a proposed roll system for role-playing games, which applied by the appropriate system, solves the following problems of other roll systems in a simple and entertaining way:

* Application of difficulties to die rolls.
* Clashes between opponents with high levels (superheroes).
* Clashes between opponents with low levels (apprentices).
* Need of complex calculations to know the probability of an action.
* Automatic success and failure as part of the system.
* Abandon the monotony of always using the same dice.

Multi takes advantage of inherent properties of the way of choosing the dice and the success calculation to achieve the above objectives without the need for any complex mental calculations.

**Definitions:**

This is a roll system, so its scope is limited to when a challenge is overcome using dice and simple mathematics. To be really useful, it still needs a system with a setting or at least a generic system and a separate setting.

A comparison with other systems: Cthulhu's Trail would be a setting on top of the generic Gumshoe system, which uses the "One die of 6 vs. difficulty" roll system.

A challenge occurs when a character needs to overcome an obstacle in the game. The character will have a level in the skill or characteristic relevant to the challenge, and the obstacle will present a difficulty to overcome. For cases where a roll is needed to determine if the obstacle is overcome, level and difficulty are contrasted.

The ability to succeed in this system is expressed in levels, with 1 being the minimum and there being no maximum.

Having a certain level in a skill does not guarantee reaching that result in every roll, on the contrary, it defines a ceiling and reaching the maximum of your ability is in fact difficult in all disciplines (This is easily contrasted in reality).

Every roll faces a difficulty expressed by a number also, minimum 1 and unlimited maximum.

Overcoming a difficulty 3 in a given challenge is not as difficult for a character with level 4 as for one with level 8 in the relevant skill or characteristic. The higher the level, the easier it is to overcome challenges.

The Multi system potentially uses all the dice on the market, between the 4-sided die and the 20-sided die.

We will use XdY to express X dice of Y faces. Example: 1d6: 1 die of 6 faces.

## Three simple rules define the system

**Rule 1:**

The player may choose whether to play with his level in the relevant skill or characteristic, or with some lower level of value, never higher, at will. To this final level we will always refer.

**Rule 2:**

The dice to roll are chosen so that their maximums add up to at least the level of the skill. If there are several combinations, the player, if not the system, will decide which combination to use.

Example: A level 5 in driving will need at least 1d6. A level 4 will need 1d4. A level 14 will need a dice combination such as 1d10+1d4, 1d8+1d6 or 2d4+1d6.

**Rule 3:**

The roll will succeed if the result equals or exceeds the challenge difficulty threshold, and at the same time does not exceed the player's own level.

Example: With level 5 and difficulty 3, the 1d6 result of 1 and 2 is failure, 3, 4 and 5 success, 6 failure.

With level 8 and difficulty 4, the result of 1d8 of 1, 2, 3 is failure, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 is success. At level 6 and difficulty 8 failure is automatic.

## Examples of use

Some ideas of how this system of rolls can be used. Although they are decisions that correspond to the rules system that finally uses it:

_Non-competitive skill example: Alice needs to cross the river, and she will do it swimming with her level 6, the difficulty is level 2, it's simple, 2 or more on a six-sided die. She rolls 4: success. Alex is level 8, no need to roll, level 2 is considered automatic success as he would use 2d4 to get 2 or more.

_Competitive skill example: Bob wants to be stealthy so as not to be detected by Carlos. The rules say that Carlos will roll for his level and Carlos will use his perception to detect him at the indicated difficulty. That is, Bob always succeeds, but at a better or worse result. He has stealth 8 so he has to choose whether to roll 1d8 or 2d4. He decides to be conservative, rolls two dice out of four and gets a 5. Now Carlos (PJ or NPC) would face his perception at that difficulty: 5.

_Combat example with Multi: Diana holds her sword with one hand, looks at Elena and weighs her options, should she go all out or tire her out? She has a level 10 sword, and decides to make a level 8 attack. If she succeeds, it is a value that Elena will not be able to counter, if she fails she will lose the initiative and Elena will be the one to attack. She rolls 1d10 and gets a 7, she fails (success is always above the difficulty and below the character's skill). If she had decided to be less daring she would not have made this mistake. Somehow, this system would translate the choice of damage to a range of different possible attacks with the sword, from going for a scratch on the arm to pulling against the jugular.

_Fred is drunk, the master will not let him use any conservative option for the rest of the night.

As we can see, this system integrates Level, Difficulty and Decisions in a very short narrative space.

## Direct consequences of the rules

Automatic failure


There can be no success if the difficulty exceeds the level in the relevant skill or characteristic.
Automatic success

A direct consequence of this system is that from level 4, the probability of rolling 1 or more with 1d4 is 100%, it is impossible to fail a roll for difficulty 1. We consider this as automatic success.

If we follow the sequence of levels, from level seven we can use 2d4, but it is not until level 8 that the probability of succeeding in a level 2 challenge is 100%.

Every four levels we will find that there is the option to have automatic success in one more level. See table of optimal combinations and conservative strategies below.

A clarification about a level 2 challenge and a skill with level 7. The rules allow us to choose 2d4 for the roll, and it will always roll 2 or more, however, if the result was 8 it would still not count as success. So no, there is no automatic success until you reach a multiple of 4.

What about level 9, does it automatically succeed for a level 2 challenge? If the clueless player chooses his or her dice wrong, 1d10, he or she may fail the roll. Because of this inconsistency, rule 1 allows you to reduce your level voluntarily, and if you play level 8, then yes, success is automatic. Master, don't be like that and give it to them as automatic if they don't realize it.
It is convenient to adjust the dice sum to the player's level.

It follows from rule 2 that a player, level 4, for a roll of difficulty 2, may want to use 1d20 to make his roll, since his maximum adds up to at least his level. There is nothing to prevent him from doing so, but rule 3 will make his decision contrary to his interests.

    If you roll 1d4, your chance of rolling at least 2, but at most 4, is 75% (Success: 2, 3 and 4. Failure: 1).
    If you roll 1d20, your probability of rolling at least 2, but at most 4, is 15% (Success: 2, 3 and 4. Failure: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20).

Rolling a dice sum as close to the level as possible is always better than rolling a dice sum that exceeds that combination. But as far as this system of rolls is concerned, it is a decision of the player, if not of the adventure system that uses it.
There are several optimal combinations from level 7 onwards

Optimal combinations for the first 12 levels
Level Combination 1 Combination 2 Combination 3 Combination 4
1 1d4 			
2 1d4 			
3 1d4 			
4 1d4 			
5 1d6 			
6 1d6 			
7 1d8 2d4 1d6 diff < 4 	
8 1d8 2d4 		
9 1d10 1d4+1d6 1d8 diff < 5 	
10 1d10 1d4+1d6 		
11 1d12 2d6 1d4+1d8 3d4
12 1d12 2d6 1d4+1d8 3d4
... 				
The choice of the die roll can be considered a game in itself.

Let's look at the probabilities of success for level 8 and any difficulty, for the two combinations of dice

[...]

F.A.Q.

Q: Couldn't rules 1 and 2 together be summed up in "roll any dice you want"?

A: Yes, but I think it's easier to assimilate in two steps. The three rules can be summed up as "Roll any dice you want, success is rolling between your level and the difficulty, both included."

Q: How might the system condition the decision of which roll strategy to choose?

A: These are only recommendations for the game system that decides to use Multi as a rolling system: A drunk or angry player might be prohibited from using conservative strategies, or have a higher perceived ability, forcing him to use dice above his level. A particularly fearful player might be forced on the contrary to use conservative strategies only, or lower levels due to his poor self-perception during a part of the game. A curse could eliminate a die (for example the 4-sided die) making the player adapt his rolls so as not to use it... These are just a few examples of how you can influence the decision and be part of the game.

Q: How does the system solve the confrontation between superheroes or between apprentices?

A: This system, at least, facilitates the following mechanism: Participate chooses the difficulty of a roll (stealth, hide, attack...), being the minimum 1 and the maximum your level. Chosen the difficulty, he makes the roll, and if successful, the other participant has to pass the roll for that difficulty. This means that a superhero can put as much trouble with a successful high difficulty roll, as an apprentice can put another apprentice in lower difficulties. Applicable to attack/defense, hide/discover, stealth/perception, etc. pairs.

Systems based on 1d100 and similar would encounter a long succession of attack/defense rolls in the case of superheroes, or a long succession of failed rolls before finding the first success in the case of apprentices. This can get boring.

Q: There are no critics and no misses?

A: They are outside the scope of a die roll system. If a setting or a generic system that uses Multi as a die-rolling system decides to introduce rules for critics and failures, that's fine, but these are usually arbitrary ranges.

Q: Are there success or failure levels?

A: They are outside the scope of a die roll system. But it might make sense for a setting or a generic system using multi as a roll system to decide that the difference between the roll and the success threshold is taken into account to define the quality of success, or there are different levels of success with much better or much worse results depending on that difference.


Q: I like the die of 100, could I play with percentages using the pre-calculated tables in this document using the levels of the characters and the difficulty of the obstacles?

A: Believe it or not, it was the first version of this system, until I found a similar result without having to consult tables using the Multi system. So: yes, you can, but it's a pain.

Q: Odd levels and levels less than four make the system more complicated. What if you remove them?

A: Well, I've thought about it, but I think it's up to the rules system to remove them and make sense of the levels. For example, levels 1-4 reserved for children, 5-8 for teenagers and non-professional adults, and 9-12 for professionals, athletes, etc. That way, challenges below 4 could be skipped and everything more or less reduced to pairs.
